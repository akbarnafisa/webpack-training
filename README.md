# Webpack Training

A webpack training repository

## Problem statement

I have a web application stored on Github (on this repository), built using `React`, `less` pre-processor.

Help me to create a webpack configuration for development (of course including HMR) and production (deploy to the Github Pages).

*Note:*

If you are not familiar with Github Pages, you need to know that GH Pages will add a prefix path in every new project.
[Read here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-your-github-pages-site)

## Expectations

- Development on `localhost:8080/` including HMR
- Production on `https://mazipan.github.io/webpack-training/`
